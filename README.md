Task: Movie Rating Prediction with Python (CodSoft Data Science Internship)
As part of the CodSoft Data Science Internship, this task focuses on building a machine learning model that predicts the rating of a movie using features such as genre, director, and actors. This is a regression-based problem that allows you to explore essential steps in a real-world data science project, including data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and model building.

üîç Objective:
To analyze historical movie data and develop a regression model that accurately estimates movie ratings based on input features. This task helps uncover the factors that influence ratings provided by users or critics.

üõ†Ô∏è Skills Demonstrated:
Data Cleaning and Exploration

Categorical Feature Encoding (e.g., Genre, Director)

Model Selection (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.)

Model Evaluation (MSE, R¬≤ Score)

Data Visualization

üì¶ Deliverables:
Cleaned dataset (if modified)

Python code (.py or .ipynb)

Model performance metrics

Summary report explaining the approach, features used, and key insights
